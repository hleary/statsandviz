#### OBJECTIVES ##########################################################################################################

# Ten epileptic patients participated in a study of a new anticonvulsant drug. 
# During the first 8-week period, half the patients received a placebo and half were given the drug, and the number of seizures were recorded. 
# Following this, the same patients were given the opposite treatment and the number of seizures were recorded. 
# Assuming that the distribution of the difference between the placebo and drug meets the assumption of normality, 
# perform an appropriate test to determine whether there were differences in the number of epileptic seizures with and without the drug.

# a) Make a boxplot of the data
# b) Test the difference.
